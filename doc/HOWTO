Setting up statistics gathering on a new machine. (*** Work in progress. ***)

0. Spin up a fresh GENI VM. (Using Ubuntu in this example.) Then do the following.

1. Clone statistics code from git repo.
git clone https://github.com/colleagueoftheprophetoffloyd/PGstatistics.git statistics

2. Install ansible and make sure it's current.
sudo apt-get -y install ansible

3. Run ansible playbook to: (a) update ansible install; (b) install docker; and
(c) setup a mySQL installation and initialize an empty protogeniHistory database.
ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local statistics/install-stuff/ansible/statistics-server.yml

*** Note: User will be added to docker group, but need to log out and log in again
to be able to execute docker commands directly. (Really shouldn't matter.)

*** Note: A random root password is generated for MySQL. It can be found in the
user's ~/.my.cnf configuration file.

4. Set up credentials. Put these two files in .ssl:
meb-emulab-special-cred.txt
utah-emulab-cleartext.pem

[The first must be obtained from Leigh. 
The second can be created by downloading Emulab credential pack from Emulab site,
getting an unencrypted version of the private key with "openssl rsa -in *credential-pack-file*",
and replacing the encrypted key with the resulting output.]

5. It's probably best to start from an archived set of history record files, which
can be just tar'd up from an existing repository:
tar cfz history.tgz statistics/ProtoGENIHistory

Copy over to the new machine, extract, and move any ingested files back
to notIngested so they'll be reprocessed into the empty mySQL database:
[[some scp commands here]]
tar xfz history.tgz
mv statistics/ProtoGENIHistory/ingested/blocks/* statistics/ProtoGENIHistory/notIngested/blocks

Remember to update protogeni-test-scripts/NEXT_RECORD_NUMBER to be one bigger than the last
index in any History-Records-XXXXX file.

Now, should be able to do a run-update.sh, which should fetch any new records and then ingest
everything.
